<h3>What is Apache Tiles</h3>
Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the
development of web application user interfaces. Tiles allows authors to
define page fragments which can be assembled into a complete page at
runtime. These fragments, or tiles, can be used as simple includes in
order to reduce the duplication of common page elements or embedded
within other tiles to develop a series of reusable templates. These
templates streamline the development of a consistent look and feel
across an entire application. Tiles grew in popularity as a component
of the popular Struts framework. It has since been extracted from
Struts and is now integrated with various frameworks, such as Struts 2.
